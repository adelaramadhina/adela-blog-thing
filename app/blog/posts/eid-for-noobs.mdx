Hey hey 👋 if you’re reading this, guess what? You’ve been invited to Adela’s Eid celebration!! 🥳✨ Whether it’s your first time hearing about Eid or you’re just here to vibe and learn more — thank you for being here 💛 You’re part of something seriously special today.

## 🌙 So, What Is Eid?

“Eid”(pronounced *eed*) is an Arabic word meaning “festival” or “feast.” Muslims celebrate two main Eids every year:

- **Eid al-Fitr** — the celebration after the month of Ramadan  
- **Eid al-Adha** — the festival of sacrifice, which commemorates the faith of Prophet Abraham

This celebration is for **Eid al-Fitr**, which marks the end of Ramadan, a month of fasting, prayer, and spiritual reflection. Throughout Ramadan, Muslims fast from sunrise to sunset — no food or drink during daylight hours — as a way to cleanse the soul, grow in patience, and remember those who go without.

The fast isn’t just physical; it’s a chance to let go of anger, gossip, bad habits, and anything that no longer serves us.

When the crescent moon is sighted, a signal that Ramadan has ended — we celebrate Eid al-Fitr with joy, food, family, friends, and above all, gratitude.

## 🕊️ The Deeper Spirit of Eid

Yes, Eid is about celebration & food (mostly food 😋). But it’s also spiritual.

At its heart, Eid is a time to:

- **Forgive past wrongs** — letting go of grudges and softening our hearts  
- **Reconnect with loved ones** — whether through phone calls, hugs, or messages  
- **Give thanks** — for what we have, what we've overcome, and who we’ve become  
- **Remember those in need** — because celebration is incomplete when others are struggling

Muslims are encouraged to be the bigger person, reconnect, and reflect on how we can be better humans — not just for us, but for the people around us too. 🌍💛

## 💛 Charity: A Non-Negotiable Part of Eid

Before Eid prayers are performed, Muslims are required to give a special charity called **Zakat al-Fitr**. This ensures that even those struggling financially can join the celebration. It’s not optional — it’s a built-in part of the festival.

But Eid charity goes even further. It’s not just about ticking a box — it’s about making the world a little softer for someone else.

Whether it's donating to support refugees, buying groceries for a struggling family, or simply offering kindness — Eid invites us all to be better neighbours, kinder friends, and more conscious members of our communities.

## 💃🏽 The Muslim Met Gala (aka Why We Dress Up ✨)

Ok sooo I may have told everyone 👀 to dress pretty today and bring their best cultural outfit... but trust me, there's a reason 😌✨

It’s not just for the aesthetic (even though yes, y'all look iconic today 💅). Dressing up for Eid actually goes way back to tradition.

Wearing your best clothes (usually people buy new cloths on the day) on Eid is a sunnah — something Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) did to honour the day. It’s a way of showing gratitude to God for making it through Ramadan, and celebrating the blessings in our lives 💫

So we dress up not for attention, but for appreciation. For joy. For community. For each other.

Your outfit today? It’s part of the celebration. It’s a hug to your heritage and shoutout to your ancestors 👑 And a reminder that joy is allowed — and sacred.

## 🌸 You Belong Here

The doors are open. The food is brought and shared together (and I hope you brought some food). The smiles are real. That’s the essence of Eid.

No matter our beliefs, backgrounds, or where we’ve come from — today is about the things we all want deep down:

Peace. Joy. Love. Forgiveness. Belonging.
And lots of delicious food 🍗🥟🍰

**Eid Mubarak 💫**  
May today remind us that there’s more that connects us than divides us friends 🫶💖
